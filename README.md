Forge 1.7.10 is no longer downloadable through AWS and therefore development cannot continue of this sole 1.7.10 repository. If you have any questions or inquiries, message me on Discord, iAmSpace#0777 (`201022516506918912`)

If my username above does not work you can find me by going to [this website](https://discord.id/) and pasting in the ID provided above.

*Though, I am still finding ways to make Forge 1.7.10 work.*

Forge time!

## Why?

funy

No, in all seriousness though, I think making CheatBreaker a Forge mod and open source can be a big benefit, as I like to use custom Forge mods all the time, and most CheatBreaker remakes/recodes/whatever you want to call them are really locked down and don't function properly sometimes. This is the core reason open source is better - pull requests! If you can fix a feature (that I can't) and can be bothered please fork this repo and send a pull request, would be greatly appreciated!
