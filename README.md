Forge time!

## Why?

funy

No, in all seriousness though, I think making CheatBreaker a Forge mod and open source can be a big benefit, as I like to use custom Forge mods all the time, and most CheatBreaker remakes/recodes/whatever you want to call them are really locked down and don't function properly sometimes. This is the core reason open source is better - pull requests! If you can fix a feature and can be bothered please fork this repo and send a pull request, would be greatly appreciated!

## How to install
